 # Getting Started

Welcome to Jupyter Notebooks in Azure Machine Learning. For more information go to [How to Use Jupyter Notebooks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/how-to-use-jupyter-notebooks)

Go to **Notebooks** tab and select the sample Notebook to view it. To edit and run cells, click **Launch Notebook Server**. Select a kernel, and wait for it to start to run cells.

**_Note_**: Do not select _Python 3_ kernel. Instead, select one of the kernels named after your project. 

You can also launch Notebook server by opening **File**, **Open Command Prompt**, and entering _az ml notebook start_.

You can explore past runs of Notebook cells using the **Run History** tab. Click the gear icon next to the list of runs, and select _Cell_ as one of colums to find specific cell runs.
